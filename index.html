            Tetris is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, called "tetrominoes", <br>
            descend from the top of the field. During this descent, the player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them <br>
            until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it. The player can neither <br>
            slow down the falling pieces nor stop them, but can accelerate them, in most versions. The objective of the game is to <br>
            use the pieces to create as many complete horizontal lines of blocks as possible. When a line is completed, it disappears, <br>
            and the blocks placed above fall one rank. Completing lines grants points, and accumulating a certain number of points or <br>
            cleared lines moves the player up a level, which increases the number of points granted per completed line<br>
          </p>
          <p class="w3-animate-bottom" style="animation-delay: 0.1s;">
            In most versions, the speed of the falling pieces increases with each level, leaving the player with less time to think <br>
            about the placement. The player can clear multiple lines at once, which can earn bonus points in some versions.<br>
            It is possible to complete up to four lines simultaneously with the use of the I-shaped tetromino; this move is called a "Tetris", <br>
            and is the basis of the game's title.<br>
          </p>
          <p class="w3-animate-bottom" style="animation-delay: 0.2s;">
            If the player cannot make the blocks disappear quickly enough, the field will start to fill; when the pieces reach the top of <br>
            the field and prevent the arrival of additional pieces, the game ends. At the end of each game, the player receives a score <br>
            based on the number of lines that have been completed. Theoretically, the game never ends with the player's victory. <br>
            The player can complete only as many lines as possible before an inevitable loss.<br>
          </p>
          <p class="w3-animate-bottom" style="animation-delay: 0.3s;">
            Since 1996, the Tetris Company has internally defined specifications and guidelines to which publishers must adhere <br>
            to be granted a license to Tetris. The contents of these guidelines establish elements such as the correspondence <br>
            of buttons and actions, the size of the field of play, and the system of rotation.<br>

        <h4>
          <p class="w3-animate-opacity">
            In 1979, Alexey Pajitnov joined the Computer Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences as a speech <br>
            recognition researcher. While he was tasked with testing the capabilities of new hardware, his ambition <br>
            was to use computers to make people happy. Pajitnov developed several puzzle games on the institute's <br>
            computer, an Electronika 60, a scarce resource at the time due in part to CoCom. For Pajitnov,<br>
            "games allow people to get to know each other better and act as revealers of things you might not normally notice, <br>
            such as their way of thinking".<br>
          </p>
          <p class="w3-animate-opacity" style="animation-delay: 0.1s;">
            In 1984, while trying to recreate a favorite puzzle game from his childhood featuring pentominoes, <br>
            Pajitnov imagined a game consisting of a descent of random pieces that the player would turn to fill rows. <br>
            Pajitnov felt that the game would be needlessly complicated with twelve different shape variations, so he scaled <br>
            the concept down to tetrominoes, of which there are seven variants. Pajitnov titled the game Tetris, a word created <br>
            from a combination of "tetra" (meaning "four") and his favorite sport, "tennis".<br>
          </p>
          <p class="w3-animate-opacity" style="animation-delay: 0.2s;">
            Because the Electronika 60 had no graphical interface, Pajitnov modelled the field and pieces using spaces and<br>
            brackets (45 lines of 80 ASCII characters). Realizing that completed lines filled the screen quickly, <br>
            Pajitnov decided to delete them, creating a key part of Tetris gameplay. This early version of Tetris had no scoring<br>
            system and no levels, but its addictive quality distinguished it from the other puzzle games Pajitnov had created. <br>
            Pajitnov wrote the game using Pascal for the RT-11 operating system on the Electronika 60.<br>
          </p>
          <p class="w3-animate-opacity" style="animation-delay: 0.3s;">
            Pajitnov had completed the first playable version of Tetris c. 1985. Pajitnov presented Tetris to his colleagues, <br>
            who quickly became addicted to it. It permeated the offices within the Academy of Sciences, and within a few weeks <br>
            it reached every Moscow institute with a computer. A friend of Pajitnov, Vladimir Pokhilko, who requested the game <br>
            for the Moscow Medical Institute, saw people stop working to play Tetris. Pokhilko eventually banned the game from <br>
            the Medical Institute to restore productivity.<br>
          </p>
          <p class="w3-animate-opacity" style="animation-delay: 0.4s;">
            Pajitnov sought to adapt Tetris to the IBM Personal Computer, which had a higher quality display than the Electronika 60.<br>
            Pajitnov recruited Vadim Gerasimov, a 16-year-old high school student who was known for his computer skills. <br>
            Pajitnov had met Gerasimov before through a mutual acquaintance, and they had worked together on previous games. <br>
            Gerasimov adapted Tetris to the IBM PC over the course of a few weeks, incorporating color and a scoreboard. <br>
            The PC port was written with Turbo Pascal.<br>
